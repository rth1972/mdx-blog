## Let's dive into the pros and cons of NextJS.
**Next.js Pros:**

1. **Server-side rendering (SSR)**: Next.js allows you to render your React components on the server, which improves SEO and page load times.
2. **Static site generation (SSG)**: Next.js can generate static HTML files for pages that don't require dynamic data, making it ideal for blogs or marketing websites.
3. **Easy internationalization**: Next.js provides built-in support for i18n, allowing you to easily add support for multiple languages and locales.
4. **Built-in support for CSS modules**: Next.js includes built-in support for CSS modules, making it easy to write modular CSS code that can be reused across your application.
5. **Integrated routing**: Next.js provides a powerful routing system that makes it easy to manage client-side routes and URL redirects.
6. **Support for Webpack**: Next.js uses Webpack under the hood, which means you get access to all of its features, including hot reloading and code splitting.
7. **Large community**: Next.js has a large and active community, which means there are many resources available to help you learn and troubleshoot.
8. **Constantly improving**: The Next.js team is actively working on new features and improvements, ensuring that the framework stays up-to-date with the latest React and JavaScript developments.

**Next.js Cons:**

1. **Steep learning curve**: Next.js has a lot of features and configurations to learn, which can be overwhelming for beginners.
2. **Over-engineering**: Some developers may find Next.js too complex or over-engineered, especially if they're not familiar with its unique features and configurations.
3. **Limited control over build process**: While Next.js provides many options for customizing your build process, some developers may feel limited in their ability to fully customize the build process.
4. **Not suitable for all use cases**: Next.js is designed primarily for building server-rendered or statically generated React applications. If you need to build a complex, real-time application with heavy JavaScript manipulation, Next.js might not be the best choice.
5. **Dependence on Node.js**: As Next.js is built on top of Node.js, it requires a compatible Node.js environment to run. This means that if your target audience doesn't use Node.js or has specific requirements for their build process, Next.js might not be the right fit.
6. **Limited support for older browsers**: While Next.js does provide some support for older browsers, you may still encounter issues with compatibility in older browser versions.

**When to choose Next.js:**

1. You're building a server-rendered or statically generated React application.
2. You need to improve SEO and page load times.
3. You want to take advantage of Next.js's built-in routing and internationalization features.
4. You're looking for a framework that provides easy access to advanced Webpack features.

**When not to choose Next.js:**

1. You're building a complex, real-time application with heavy JavaScript manipulation.
2. You have specific requirements that aren't met by Next.js (e.g., custom build process or compatibility with older browsers).
3. You're already comfortable with another React framework or library and don't need the additional features of Next.js.

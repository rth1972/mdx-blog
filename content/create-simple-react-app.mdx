## How to Create a React App
To use Create React App, we first need to open our terminal or command line on our computer.

To create a new React project, we can use the tool npx, provided you have an npm version of at least 5.2.

npx gives us the ability to use the create-react-app package without having to first install it on our computer, which is very convenient.

Using npx also ensures that we are using latest version of Create React App to create our project:

```python:Terminal
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

Once we run this command, a folder named "my-react-app" will be created where we specified on our computer and all of the packages it requires will be automatically installed.

> **_NOTE:_**  Creating a new React app with create-react-app will usually take 2-3 minutes, sometimes more.

Create React App also gives us some templates to use for specific types of React projects.

For example, if we wanted to create a React project that used the tool TypeScript, we could use a template for that instead of having to install TypeScript manually.

To create a React app that uses TypeScript, we can use the Create React App TypeScript template:

```{code}javascript:Terminal
npx create-react-app my-react-app --template typescript
```

## How to Run your React Project

Once you have dragged your project into your code editor, you can open up your terminal (in VSCode, go to View > Terminal).

To start your React project, you can simply run:

```python:Terminal
npm start
```

When we run our project, a new browser tab will automatically open on our computer's default browser to view our app.

The development server will start up on localhost:3000 and, right away, we can see the starting home page for our app.

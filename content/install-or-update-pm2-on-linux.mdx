## What is PM2

PM2 (Process Manager 2) is an open-source production-ready Node.js process manager. It provides several essential features for managing Node.js applications in a production environment:

1. **Automatic Load Balancing:** PM2 includes a built-in load balancer that distributes incoming requests across multiple application instances. This improves performance and reliability, especially on multi-core machines.

1. **Declarative Application Configuration:** You can define your application’s configuration (such as environment variables, arguments, and execution options) in a declarative way using PM2. This makes it easier to manage and maintain your applications.

1. **Zero Downtime Reload:** PM2 allows you to update your application without any downtime. When you reload your app, PM2 gracefully transitions to the new version, ensuring uninterrupted service.

1. **Log Management:** PM2 provides tools for managing logs. You can view logs in various formats (standard, raw, JSON, or formatted) and easily consult them using commands like pm2 logs.

1. **Startup Scripts:** You can create startup scripts to ensure that your Node.js applications automatically start when the system boots up. PM2 makes it straightforward to set up these scripts.

1. **Monitoring and Metrics:** PM2 offers monitoring capabilities, allowing you to track application metrics, resource usage, and other vital information. You can enable host monitoring and use terminal-based monitoring as well.

1. **Container Support:** With the pm2-runtime command, you can run your Node.js applications in a production environment seamlessly. It’s a drop-in replacement for the node command.

In summary, PM2 simplifies the management of Node.js applications, making them more robust, scalable, and reliable in production. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask! 😊

## Update PM2

To update PM2 to the latest version, run:
```
npm install pm2@latest -g && pm2 update
```

The pm2 update command ensures that the in-memory PM2 daemon is refreshed with the latest changes.
That’s it! Your PM2 installation should now be up to date. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊

# 📶 Home Assistant: Wi-Fi Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to connect your Home Assistant device to Wi-Fi:

---

### 1️⃣ Connect Peripherals

Connect a **monitor** and **keyboard** to your Home Assistant device.

---

### 2️⃣ Access the Root Shell

At the `ha>` prompt, enter:

```bash
login
```
This command will change your prompt from ha> to # (the root shell prompt).

3️⃣ Check Wi-Fi Status
Ensure Wi-Fi is functioning:


```bash
nmcli radio
```
4️⃣ Scan for Available Networks
Initiate a scan:

```bash
nmcli device wifi rescan
```

List the available Wi-Fi access points:

```bash
nmcli device wifi
```

5️⃣ Connect to Your Wi-Fi
Connect to your Wi-Fi using your actual SSID and password (include quotes):

```bash
nmcli device wifi connect "YOUR_SSID" password "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
```

This will attempt to connect to your network and generate a profile if successful. You should see output like:

Device 'wlan0' successfully activated with...


6️⃣ Show Active Connections
Check active and saved network connections:

```bash
nmcli con show
```

7️⃣ Identify Your IP Address
Check both Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces for assigned IPs:

```bash
ip addr show
```

8️⃣ Access Home Assistant
Open your browser and go to:

```text
http://your_wifi_ip:8123
```

Replace your_wifi_ip with the actual IP address you found in the previous step.

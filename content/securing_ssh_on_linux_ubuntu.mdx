# 🔐 **Securing SSH on Linux/Ubuntu — Tutorial**

SSH is the primary remote‑access method for Linux systems, which makes it a high‑value target. Hardening it reduces attack surface, improves auditability, and protects your infrastructure.

This guide covers:

- Understanding SSH risks  
- Hardening the SSH configuration  
- Strengthening authentication  
- Restricting access  
- Monitoring and maintenance  

Everything here is safe, defensive, and appropriate for legitimate system administration.

# 1. 🧠 **Understand the Risks**

Before securing SSH, it helps to know what attackers typically target:

- Password‑guessing attempts  
- Default or weak credentials  
- Exposed SSH ports  
- Outdated cryptographic algorithms  
- Unrestricted access from the internet  
- Lack of monitoring or rate limiting  

Your goal is to reduce exposure and enforce strong authentication.

# 2. 🔧 **Update Your System**

Keeping the system updated ensures you have the latest security patches.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

---

# 3. 🔑 **Set Up SSH Key Authentication**

SSH keys are far stronger than passwords.

### Generate a key pair (on your local machine)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

### Copy the public key to the server

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@server-ip
```

This installs your public key into:

```
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

---

# 4. 🛡️ **Harden the SSH Configuration**

Edit the SSH daemon config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Apply these defensive settings:

### ✔ Disable root login

```
PermitRootLogin no
```

### ✔ Disable password authentication (after confirming key login works)

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

### ✔ Disable empty passwords

```
PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

### ✔ Use modern cryptography

```
KexAlgorithms sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com
HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-ed25519
PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms ssh-ed25519
```

### ✔ Limit authentication attempts

```
MaxAuthTries 3
```

### ✔ Reduce login grace time

```
LoginGraceTime 20
```

### ✔ Optional: Change the SSH port

This doesn’t replace real security, but it reduces noise from automated scans.

```
Port 2222
```

### Restart SSH

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

---

# 5. 🌍 **Restrict SSH Access by IP (Optional but Strong)**

If you know where you’ll connect from, restrict access using UFW.

### Allow only your IP

```bash
sudo ufw allow from YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE to any port 22
```

### Or allow a trusted subnet

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 22
```

### Enable UFW

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

---

# 6. 🚫 **Use Fail2Ban for Brute‑Force Protection**

Fail2Ban monitors logs and blocks abusive IPs.

Install:

```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban
```

Create a local jail config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Example:

```
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd
maxretry = 3
bantime = 1h
findtime = 10m
```

Restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

---

# 7. 📜 **Enable Logging & Monitoring**

SSH logs are stored in:

```
/var/log/auth.log
```

Monitor login attempts:

```bash
sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
```

Track successful logins:

```bash
sudo grep "Accepted" /var/log/auth.log
```

This helps detect suspicious activity early.

---

# 8. 🧪 **Test Everything Before Closing Your Session**

Always open a **second SSH session** before restarting or locking down SSH.  
This prevents locking yourself out.

Checklist:

- Can you log in with your new user?  
- Does key authentication work?  
- Is root login disabled?  
- Are password logins disabled?  
- Does Fail2Ban block failed attempts?  

Only after confirming everything works should you close your original session.

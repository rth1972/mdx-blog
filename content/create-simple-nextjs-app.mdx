## How to Create a Next.js App

The easiest way to create a new Next.js application is by using the create-next-app CLI tool. 
Follow these steps:
 - First, install the create-next-app package globally (if you haven’t already):

```javascript:Terminal
npm install -g create-next-app
```

 - Initialize a new Next.js application by calling the tool and supplying a name for your project:

```javascript:Terminal
npx create-next-app my-next-app
```

Replace `my-next-app` with your desired project name. This command will set up a new Next.js project with everything configured for you.

 - Run your app in development mode:

```javascript:Terminal
npm run dev
```

Your Next.js app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

Manual Wi-Fi Connection Guide
=============================

An interactive guide to connecting to Wi-Fi without a network manager.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, ensure you have the following information and access. This guide assumes you are starting from a basic command prompt and need to establish a network connection to proceed.

*   Your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password.
*   Physical access to the device with a connected monitor and keyboard.
*   The \`wpa\_supplicant\` package, which is typically installed by default on most Linux distributions.

Connection Steps
----------------

Follow these steps sequentially. Each step provides a command that you can copy and paste directly into your terminal. This process will take you from the initial prompt to a fully networked device.

### Step 1: Identify Your Wi-Fi Interface

Find the name of your wireless network device. It usually starts with \`wlan\` or \`wlp\`. Note this name for the following steps.

```bash
ip link show
```


### Step 2: Activate the Wi-Fi Interface

Enable the wireless device. Replace \`wlan0\` with the interface name you found in the previous step.

```bash
ip link set wlan0 up
```

### Step 3: Generate Network Configuration

Create a configuration file with your Wi-Fi credentials. \*\*Remember to replace \`YOUR\_SSID\` and \`YOUR\_WIFI\_PASSWORD\`\*\* with your actual network name and password.

```bash
wpa_passphrase "YOUR_SSID" "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD" > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

### Step 4: Start the Connection Process

Run the \`wpa\_supplicant\` tool in the background to manage the Wi-Fi connection using the file you just created. Remember to use your correct interface name instead of \`wlan0\`.

```bash
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

### Step 5: Obtain an IP Address

Request an IP address from your network's DHCP server. This allows your device to communicate on the network.

```bash
dhclient wlan0
```

### Step 6: Verify Connection

Check if your device successfully obtained an IP address. Look for an \`inet\` entry in the output.

```bash
ip addr show wlan0
```

Important Considerations
------------------------

Connection is Not Persistent

This manual connection is temporary and will be lost upon reboot. For a permanent setup, you must configure your system's network scripts (e.g., \`/etc/network/interfaces\` on Debian/Ubuntu or using \`systemd-networkd\`).

Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check kernel messages with \`dmesg\` or system logs with \`journalctl -xe\` for errors related to your Wi-Fi device or \`wpa\_supplicant\`.

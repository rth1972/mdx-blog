clone your bootable SD card on macOS. Here's how you can do it using the `dd` command:

1. **Insert Both SD Cards**: Connect both the source SD card and the target (larger) SD card to your Mac using SD card readers.

2. **Identify the Device Names**: Open Terminal and run the following command to list all disk devices:
   ```bash
   diskutil list
   ```
   Note down the device names for both your source and target SD cards (e.g., `/dev/disk2` and `/dev/disk3`). Be very careful to correctly identify the source and target devices to avoid data loss.

3. **Unmount the Target SD Card**: Unmount the target SD card using the following command:
   ```bash
   diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk3
   ```
   Replace `/dev/disk3` with the actual device name of your target SD card.

4. **Copy the Source SD Card to the Target SD Card**: Use the `dd` command to copy the entire content of the source SD card to the target SD card:
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 of=/dev/disk3 bs=4M
   ```
   Replace `/dev/disk2` and `/dev/disk3` with the actual device names of your source and target SD cards. The `bs=4M` option sets the block size to 4 megabytes for faster copying.

5. **Wait for the Process to Complete**: The `dd` command will take some time to complete, depending on the size of your SD cards. Be patient and avoid interrupting the process.

6. **Eject the SD Cards**: Once the copying is complete, safely eject both SD cards using the following command:
   ```bash
   diskutil eject /dev/disk2
   diskutil eject /dev/disk3
   ```

Now your target SD card should be an exact copy of your source SD card, including all bootable content. You can insert it into your device to test if it's working correctly.

In React (and therefore, Next.js), a "hook" is a way to use state and other React features without writing a class component.
Hooks allow you to "hook into" React state and lifecycle methods from functional components.

Here are some built-in hooks in React:

* `useState`: Creates a state variable and an update function.
* `useEffect`: Allows you to run side effects (e.g., making API calls) after rendering.
* `useContext`: Provides access to context objects, like a theme or a user object.
* `useReducer`: Similar to `useState`, but with more features for managing complex state.
* `useCallback`: Memoizes a function so that it's not recreated on every render.
* `useMemo`: Memoizes a value so that it's not recalculated on every render.

To use these hooks, you can simply import the `React` library and then use them in your functional component:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
In this example, we're using the `useState` hook to create a state variable `count` and an update function `setCount`. We can
then use these in our component.

These built-in hooks are part of React's core functionality, so you don't need to install any additional libraries to use them.

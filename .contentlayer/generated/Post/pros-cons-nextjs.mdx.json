If you need to build a complex, real-time application with heavy JavaScript manipulation, Next.js might not be the best choice.\n5. **Dependence on Node.js**: As Next.js is built on top of Node.js, it requires a compatible Node.js environment to run. This means that if your target audience doesn't use Node.js or has specific requirements for their build process, Next.js might not be the right fit.\n6. **Limited support for older browsers**: While Next.js does provide some support for older browsers, you may still encounter issues with compatibility in older browser versions.\n\n**When to choose Next.js:**\n\n1. You're building a server-rendered or statically generated React application.\n2. You need to improve SEO and page load times.\n3. You want to take advantage of Next.js's built-in routing and internationalization features.\n4. You're looking for a framework that provides easy access to advanced Webpack features.\n\n**When not to choose Next.js:**\n\n1. You're building a complex, real-time application with heavy JavaScript manipulation.\n2. You have specific requirements that aren't met by Next.js (e.g., custom build process or compatibility with older browsers).\n3. You're already comfortable with another React framework or library and don't need the additional features of Next.js.",
